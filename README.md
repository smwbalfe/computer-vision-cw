# Computer Vision Coursework Repository

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts designed to explore fundamental concepts and techniques in computer vision. Each component of the repository focuses on a distinct aspect of computer vision, providing both theoretical background and practical implementations.

## Core Features

### 1. Convolutions (convolutions.ipynb)

This notebook introduces image convolution, a fundamental operation in computer vision. Image convolution is a technique that can apply various filters to an image to achieve effects such as edge detection, blurring, and sharpening. Through practical examples, you'll learn how to implement basic convolution operations on grayscale images and understand their significance in:

- Edge detection in computer vision systems.
- Image processing in software like Photoshop.
- Deep learning, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

### 2. Image Warping (image_warping.ipynb)

Image warping is explored in this notebook, demonstrating how images can be transformed or warped. The notebook guides you through the implementation of forward mapping and backward mapping techniques, which are crucial for:

- Image registration, where different images of the same scene are aligned.
- Augmented reality, where virtual images are accurately overlaid on real-world images.

### 3. Template Matching (template_matching.py)

This Python script demonstrates template matching, a method used in computer vision to find parts of an image that match a template image. The script showcases:

- The creation of image pyramids to perform template matching at multiple scales.
- Rotation-based matching to identify objects regardless of their orientation.
- The effectiveness of template matching in object recognition tasks.

### 4. Transformations (transformations.ipynb)

This notebook delves into 2D matrix transformations, essential for manipulating and animating shapes in computer vision. It covers:

- Basic transformations, including scaling, translation, and rotation.
- Compound transformations, which combine multiple basic transformations into a single operation.
- The practical applications of these transformations in tasks like object tracking and image augmentation.
